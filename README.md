# Start developing

```
git clone https://github.com/yorkulibraries/gaia.git
cd gaia
docker compose up --build
```

There are 3 containers created: **web**, **db** and **mailcatcher**

# Access the front end web app in DEVELOPMENT 

http://localhost:3007/

By default, the application will listen on port 3004 and runs with RAILS_ENV=development.

To access the application in Chrome browser, you will need to add the ModHeader extension to your Chrome browser.

Header: PYORK_USER
Value: admin (or manager or whatever user you want to mimic)

For convenience, you can import the ModHeader profile from the included ModHeader_admin.json. 

# Access mailcatcher web app

http://localhost:3087/

# What if I want to use a different port?

If you wish to use a different port, you can set the PORT environment or change PORT in .env file.

```
PORT=4005 docker compose up --build
```

# Run tests

Start the containers if you haven't started them yet.

```
